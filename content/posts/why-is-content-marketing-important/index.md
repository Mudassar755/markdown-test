But many businesses may not realize that content marketing is one of the [most important aspects of online marketing](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/hubspot-blog-marketing-industry-trends-report).

By creating high-quality content, businesses can attract customers and keep them engaged with their brand. Content marketing also helps build trust and credibility with potential and current customers.

So why is content marketing so important? We'll explore that question and more in this blog post.

## What Is Content Marketing?

Content marketing is a strategic approach focused on creating and distributing valuable, relevant, and consistent content to attract and retain a clearly defined audience — and, ultimately, to drive profitable customer action.

In other words, content marketing is about creating informative and exciting content that will interest your target audience and encourage them to take action.

This could be anything from subscribing to your email list to purchasing on your website. Therefore, content marketing is vital to reach and engage with potential and current customers.

## 5 Benefits That Content Marketing Provides

There are several benefits of content marketing but hopefully these five will compel you to start crafting your content marketing strategy today.

### 1. Connect and Build Meaningful Relationships With Your Customers

Content marketing allows you to connect with your audience on a deeper level, providing valuable information that helps them make informed decisions about your products or services.

This creates a stronger bond between you and your customer base and sets you apart from your competition, who may not be utilizing this powerful marketing tool.

Think about it — when was the last time you purchased from a company without researching beforehand? We’re willing to bet it’s been a while!

These days, [consumers are savvier than ever](https://startupbonsai.com/content-marketing-statistics/). They want to know they’re making the best decision before handing over their hard-earned cash. This is what the 2018 Content Preferences Survey Report found out about a person’s buying journey:

> 71% of consumers check a blog as they went through their buying journey. People also listened to podcasts (64%), looked at infographics (76%), read case studies (79%), attended webinars (66%), and watched videos (49%). - 2018 Content Preferences Survey Report

That’s where content marketing comes in.

Creating helpful, informative content gives your customers the information they need to make an informed decision about your business. When they choose to work with you, they’ll be doing so with confidence, knowing that you’re a company that cares about helping them succeed.

### 2. Boosts Your Brand

Content marketing is creating and sharing content [that helps you promote your business](https://www.oberlo.com/blog/content-marketing-statistics). It's not about selling but providing valuable information to aid your target audience.

For example, if you sell software, you might write an article about how to use it effectively. Or, if you're a website design company, you could write a blog post about the latest web design trends.

By providing valuable information, you'll be able to build trust and relationships with your audience. This will make them more likely to do business with you when they're ready to buy. 

There are many different types of content you can create, here are a few to consider:
- Blog Posts
- Articles
- Social Media Posts
- Infographics
- Press Release
- Podcasts
- Videos

The important thing is to find the right mix for your business. Not all companies will benefit from every type of content.

For example, a B2B company might find that blog posts and articles are most effective. In contrast, a B2C company might find videos and infographics more engaging.

Experimenting and tracking your results is the best way to figure out what works for your business. Try different types of content and see which ones get the most engagement from your audience.

### 3. Drives Traffic to Your Website

Content marketing is a great way to drive traffic to your website. Creating helpful, informative content can attract new visitors and encourage them to explore your site.

And the more time visitors spend on your site, the more likely they are to convert into leads or customers.

## What Effective Content Marketing Looks Like

### Engaging

Content marketing should feel like a conversation between friends or an informative story from an expert. The content should be something the reader can easily connect with on a personal level and be able to visualize and use in their own lives.

For example, a post about [choosing the right paint colors](https://www.thespruce.com/choosing-interior-paint-colors-4011484) for your home office could include personal anecdotes about how different colors affected the author's mood and productivity.

It would also provide helpful tips on light availability and furniture placement. Ultimately, the goal is to make the reader feel like they've learned something valuable that they can use in their lives.

### Educational

Content marketing is effective when it provides valuable information that helps the reader solve a problem or overcome a challenge.

For example, a home improvement store could write an article on [how to install a ceiling fan](https://www.thisoldhouse.com/ceilings/21016468/how-to-install-a-ceiling-fan), "How to Install a Ceiling Fan," which would be helpful for someone who has never installed one before. The store is establishing itself as a trusted resource and expert in its field by providing this valuable content.

Educational content marketing can be a potent tool for businesses when executed correctly.

It can help build trust and credibility with potential customers while providing valuable information to help them make better purchasing decisions. To create more compelling content marketing, focus on creating educational pieces that genuinely benefit your audience.

### Relevant

Content marketing is about creating and sharing relevant content with your target audience. It's also important to provide value to your readers and help them solve their problems.

For example, suppose you're a business that sells products or services to small businesses. In that case, your content should be relevant to your target audience.

This means writing about topics important to small businesses and providing valuable information to help them grow their businesses. For example, Kabbage is a platform that helps small businesses find loans that they can easily apply for and pay. For that reason, they're also creating helpful tips for small businesses.

If you can provide value to your target audience through your content, you'll be able to build trust and relationships with them. When they're ready to buy, they'll remember your company and return to you.

### Consistent

Lastly, content marketing is most effective when it's done consistently. This means publishing new content regularly and promoting it through your social media channels and email list.

It can be challenging to maintain a consistent content schedule. Still, it's essential if you want to see results from your content marketing efforts.

If you're unsure how often you should publish new content, start with once a week and then increase the frequency as you're able to. The most important thing is to be consistent with your content so that your audience knows when to expect new pieces from you.

## Final Thoughts

Content marketing provides several advantages for businesses to thrive in the digital world, but it's important to know what makes content marketing effective.

When creating content, focus on making it engaging, educational, relevant, and consistent. If you can do all of those things, you'll be well on your way to creating content that will help your business succeed.
